GA Project 2

Extra things to add:
- Users should be able to add comments to video posts
    - Video posts show the comments and the users who posted
    - Users can only leave comments if logged in
- Use Passport for user authorization through Facebook, FitBit, etc
- Flash messages to show errors in forms
- Write a method where the user can just enter the share link and I edit the link to make it embedded
- Have users click on different users' profile pages and leave comments
- Add better nav logic to the videos index and show page (still can't find the current user that's logged in for those public pages)
- When editing a video, have the previous wkout category (drop down list) saved so the user can see what the wkout category is.
